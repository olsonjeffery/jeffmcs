2010-12-10 20:26:55 [INFO] <bik> someone was in my house and didn't shut the door
2010-12-10 20:27:04 [INFO] <pfox__> wasn't me, i warped in
2010-12-10 20:28:06 [INFO] <pfox__> i was just day-dreaming about a scheme to start updating the server and hmod daily via a script
2010-12-10 20:28:17 [INFO] <pfox__> hmod has a CI server that you can dl the latest build from
2010-12-10 20:28:35 [INFO] <pfox__> and you can just delete the vanilla server jar to get hmod to dl a new one
2010-12-10 20:28:49 [INFO] <pfox__> so i thought thatd be neat.. to keep on the bleeding edge
2010-12-10 20:29:04 [INFO] <bik> yeah
2010-12-10 20:29:15 [INFO] <bik> I build a portal not knowing they didn't work MP

2010-12-10 20:29:26 [INFO] <pfox__> good times
2010-12-10 20:29:38 [INFO] <pfox__> i dont think it'll be supported.. they're seperate maps
2010-12-10 20:30:05 [INFO] <pfox__> it really should be supported, though.. it'd be cool for single-player, too
2010-12-10 20:30:13 [INFO] <pfox__> so mobs would follow you out of portals and stuff
2010-12-10 20:31:06 [INFO] <pfox__> and btw.. you know you can smelt cobbleshit back to smooth stone, right?

2010-12-11 13:52:12 [INFO] <pfox__> there's a whole world to destroy
2010-12-11 13:52:59 [INFO] <amadday> yea but if u wanted to play alone y play multi player?
2010-12-11 13:53:37 [INFO] <pfox__> hey im not making a huge deal out of it.. we all have our "works" that we want to work on to share
2010-12-11 13:53:55 [INFO] <pfox__> i considered the entire flating island area "my work"
2010-12-11 13:54:09 [INFO] <pfox__> and if i were throwing a huge fit, id tear it all down and kick/ban you. but im not.
2010-12-11 13:54:14 [INFO] <pfox__> just saying.
2010-12-11 13:54:28 [INFO] <amadday> u can tear it down
2010-12-11 13:54:37 [INFO] <moshea> heh
2010-12-11 13:55:13 [INFO] <pfox__> nah its no big deal. a heads up would've been nice. but i wasn't on last night.
2010-12-11 13:55:19 [INFO] <moshea> so... how does that indestructible zone work?
2010-12-11 13:55:36 [INFO] <amadday> its by the spawn point
2010-12-11 13:55:44 [INFO] <pfox__> its indestructible, pretty much. you, me, anyone.. can't destroy those blocks around the spawn
2010-12-11 13:55:44 [INFO] <amadday> u cant fuck with shit there
2010-12-11 13:55:55 [INFO] <pfox__> it extends all the way to the bedrock layer at the bottom of the map
2010-12-11 13:55:58 [INFO] <moshea> 16 block radius?
2010-12-11 13:56:05 [INFO] <pfox__> if you place a block in that zone.. it'll become indestructible
2010-12-11 13:56:15 [INFO] <pfox__> so the best thing to do is to just avoid building near it
2010-12-11 13:57:39 [INFO] <pfox__> there may or may not be a smarter/better way to deal with it, but i haven't invested any energy in f
2010-12-11 13:57:45 [INFO] <pfox__> in figuring it out.
2010-12-11 13:58:05 [INFO] <pfox__> and, like i said, we have a whole world to destroy
2010-12-11 13:58:37 [INFO] <amadday> i hate when u die far from the spawn point tho
2010-12-11 13:58:45 [INFO] <moshea> right. this is just my home base I guess
2010-12-11 13:58:53 [INFO] <pfox__> you can set a "home" location with /sethome
2010-12-11 13:58:58 [INFO] <pfox__> that you'll return to when you die
2010-12-11 13:59:06 [INFO] <pfox__> well no, you'll return to spawn
2010-12-11 13:59:06 [INFO] <amadday> oh cool
