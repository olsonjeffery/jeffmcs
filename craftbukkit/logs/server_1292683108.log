2010-12-18 18:05:13 [INFO] <moshea> I spotted it from the air!
2010-12-18 18:05:25 [INFO] <pfox__> what's that? the dome?
2010-12-18 18:05:27 [INFO] <pfox__> it's not done yet
2010-12-18 18:05:32 [INFO] <moshea> yeah. very cool
2010-12-18 18:05:43 [INFO] <pfox__> its really easy to see at night
2010-12-18 18:05:48 [INFO] <pfox__> did you see the screenshot of the server?
2010-12-18 18:05:56 [INFO] <moshea> the latest?
2010-12-18 18:06:07 [INFO] <pfox__> oh, just curious if scott told you about the web server stuff
2010-12-18 18:06:11 [INFO] <pfox__> seems you know, so nm
2010-12-18 18:06:14 [INFO] <pfox__> i updated it earlier today
2010-12-18 18:06:30 [INFO] <pfox__> its still manually updated.. i need to get some automation around that..
2010-12-18 18:06:35 [INFO] <pfox__> i want to do some other things, too
2010-12-18 18:06:36 [INFO] <moshea> noticed. can't wait to see the nex one
2010-12-18 18:07:15 [INFO] <pfox__> yeah i need to make thumbnails that aren't 15+ megs in size
2010-12-18 18:07:21 [INFO] <pfox__> display those instead, as links to the full img
2010-12-18 18:07:27 [INFO] <pfox__> and i want to do a nighttime img of server
2010-12-18 18:07:43 [INFO] <pfox__> the man-made structures stand out a lot more at night w/ torches, etc
2010-12-18 18:07:54 [INFO] <moshea> is there a cmd line interface?
2010-12-18 18:08:10 [INFO] <pfox__> for what? server admin?
2010-12-18 18:08:16 [INFO] <moshea> yep
2010-12-18 18:08:20 [INFO] <pfox__> yeah.. i can do some things directly from the server interface
2010-12-18 18:08:29 [INFO] <pfox__> but generating a screenshot happens outside the server
2010-12-18 18:08:39 [INFO] <pfox__> by reading the world files.. there's an external app i use call mcmap for that
2010-12-18 18:08:52 [INFO] <pfox__> there are some others, too.. notably cartographer (the most popular.. but its .net and shitty)
2010-12-18 18:09:04 [INFO] <moshea> heh
2010-12-18 18:09:05 [INFO] <pfox__> in linux, anyways.. mcmap is in c++, portable and way, way faster
2010-12-18 18:09:24 [INFO] <pfox__> well when i say "shitty", im mostly talking about perf and portability
2010-12-18 18:09:37 [INFO] <pfox__> mcmap is better in both.. i believe cartographer has quite a few more features
2010-12-18 18:09:38 [INFO] <moshea> is the VM a linux instance?
2010-12-18 18:09:57 [INFO] <pfox__> it's not a vm.. the server is runner on an ubuntu server machine underneath my desk at home
2010-12-18 18:10:12 [INFO] <moshea> ah linus nontheless.. :)
2010-12-18 18:10:33 [INFO] <moshea> should be easy to script then
2010-12-18 18:10:43 [INFO] <pfox__> yeah.. the web server is node.js
2010-12-18 18:10:58 [INFO] <pfox__> and im going to install a mod to expose from RESTful JSON stuff for the minecraft server
2010-12-18 18:11:09 [INFO] <pfox__> that i can hit from the web server to expose some functionality/stats on the web
2010-12-18 18:11:23 [INFO] <moshea> nice
2010-12-18 18:11:27 [INFO] <pfox__> but mostly i want to automate the worldpic process and pretty it up a bit
