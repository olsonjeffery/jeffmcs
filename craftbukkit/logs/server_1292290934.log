2010-12-13 22:01:21 [INFO] <moshea> yeah. and about 12 hours of mining. insane.
2010-12-13 22:01:58 [INFO] <pfox__> you just need to find big lava caverns.. thats where the best veins are
2010-12-13 22:02:12 [INFO] <pfox__> so i do a lot of tunnel/exploratory digging
2010-12-13 22:02:18 [INFO] <pfox__> instead of hollowing out large spaces
2010-12-13 22:02:22 [INFO] <moshea> tx for the tip
2010-12-13 22:03:04 [INFO] <moshea> I've got some large lava flows at one end of my mine
2010-12-13 22:03:14 [INFO] <moshea> should I be poking around those more?
2010-12-13 22:03:18 [INFO] <pfox__> you guys all dug down to the bedrock
2010-12-13 22:03:22 [INFO] <pfox__> you should go up ten tiles
2010-12-13 22:03:28 [INFO] <pfox__> and then dig 2x2 tunnels from there
2010-12-13 22:03:45 [INFO] <pfox__> the reason you guys have lava fountains is because you dig out the bottoms
2010-12-13 22:03:48 [INFO] <pfox__> of the lava pools
2010-12-13 22:04:05 [INFO] <pfox__> if you find the cavern that is atop that lava pool and build a path to explore
2010-12-13 22:04:10 [INFO] <pfox__> you'll find lots of good stuff
2010-12-13 22:04:24 [INFO] <moshea> oh ho!
